GUTPOEMS DTD V 1.0
==================

GENERAL NOTES
+++++++++++++
This is gutpoems dtd version 1.0
file name is gutpoems1.dtd
This dtd is a first pass at a dtd for marking up 
poetry and books of poetry.
It was developed for marking up the poems of Robert burns.
One of the problems with poems is that as every line
requires a seperate element object, complete books of 
poetry can take a long time to render on browsers.

For this reason the books can be divided into parts using the
poemsfrag element.

These fragments can be included using external entities
